The hidden bits are shown in level13-stego1.png highlighted in red. These bits are noticeably out
of place because a "normal" bitstream in this physical layout has all zeros (or all ones) in this
region. Consulting the Xilinx CPLD address map files also shows that nothing is assigned to these
bits.

The answer is therefore 141efaea79fc06d1.
