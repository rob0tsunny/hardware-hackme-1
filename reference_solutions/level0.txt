This is a manual algorithm for solving level 0. Because level 0 gives a correct/wrong determination
instantly after every digit, it is possible to brute-force each digit independently. This reduces
the search space from 10000 guesses to just 40 guesses (10 guesses for each digit).

The manual algorithm is:
1. Input a 0. Note if an error was immediately returned or not.
2. If an error was returned, repeat step 1 with digits 1..9 inclusive.
3. If no error is returned, remember this value as the value of the first digit.
4. Repeat the entire process starting from 1, but prefix all guesses with the remembered digits.
