The hidden bits are shown in level14-stego2-phys.png highlighted in red. These bits are noticeably
out of place because of a number of reasons. First of all, they use far more inputs than normal
(seen as many zero bits). Second of all, they are towards the "end" of the macrocell. However, the
terms that come before (which are to the right of the red box in this image) are all unused. This
is not the normal pattern that the compiler will use to allocate product terms. Finally, all of
these product terms have runs of 0 bits in such a way that it will select both an input and its
complement to be ANDed together. This does not make sense because the result would be a constant
zero.

To read the secret data, the bitstream needs to be converted back into "logical" bit ordering (the
hint that the answer is ASCII text helps to show this). Once that is done, the result is shown
below:

Converting the bits in the last 7 macrocells into ASCII text yields
"The magic words weren't squeamish ossifrage this time. Disappointing.." which is indeed the
answer.
